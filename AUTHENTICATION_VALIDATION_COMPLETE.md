## üîÑ WORKFLOW VALIDATION

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Doctor attempts to schedule appointment for donor**
2. **System checks donor eligibility using `isDonorEligibleForAppointment()`**
3. **If eligible**: Appointment modal opens, scheduling proceeds normally
4. **If not eligible**: Error toast shown, modal blocked, reason displayed

### Eligible Statuses:
- `INITIALLY_APPROVED` - Admin initially approved donor
- `ADMIN_APPROVED` - Admin fully approved donor  
- `FINAL_APPROVED` - Final approval completed
- Legacy string equivalents: 'initially-approved', 'admin-approved', 'approved'

### Ineligible Statuses with Specific Messages:
- `PENDING` ‚Üí "Donor application is still under initial review"
- `INITIAL_DOCTOR_APPROVED` ‚Üí "Donor needs initial admin approval before appointments can be scheduled"
- `PENDING_INITIAL_ADMIN_APPROVAL` ‚Üí "Donor is waiting for initial admin approval"
- `INITIAL_ADMIN_REJECTED` ‚Üí "Donor was rejected by admin during initial review"
- `INITIAL_DOCTOR_REJECTED` ‚Üí "Donor was rejected during initial medical review"
- `DOCTOR_REJECTED` ‚Üí "Donor was rejected after medical evaluation"
- `ADMIN_REJECTED` ‚Üí "Donor application was rejected by administration"
- `FINAL_REJECTED` ‚Üí "Donor application was finally rejected"

## üéâ SYSTEM STATUS

**‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM COMPLETE**

The authentication system successfully prevents doctors from scheduling appointments for donors before initial admin approval. The system provides:

1. **Robust Authentication**: Checks donor eligibility before allowing appointment scheduling
2. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Multiple UI indicators show eligibility status at a glance  
3. **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Specific reasons provided for ineligible donors
4. **Consistent User Experience**: Uniform behavior across all components
5. **Security**: Prevents unauthorized appointment scheduling attempts

The system builds on the previously implemented initial admin approval workflow and ensures that doctors can only schedule appointments for donors who have received proper administrative approval.

## üìã NEXT STEPS (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Add server-side validation for additional security
- [ ] Implement appointment scheduling logs for audit trails
- [ ] Add bulk eligibility status updates for administrators
- [ ] Create reports on appointment scheduling patterns
- [ ] Add email notifications when donor eligibility status changes
